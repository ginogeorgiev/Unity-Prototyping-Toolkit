## Purpose of the Toolkit

The primary purpose of the Unity Prototyping Toolkit is to address the challenges faced during the prototyping phase of game development. Traditional prototyping methods can be time-consuming and intricate, often hindering the rapid iteration and experimentation crucial for creating engaging gameplay experiences. This toolkit seeks to offer a solution by providing a range of features and modules that cater to the specific needs of developers.
## Key Benefits

- **Accelerated Development:** By providing pre-built logic and components commonly needed in game prototypes, the toolkit accelerates the process of turning ideas into interactive experiences.

- **Clear Project Structure:** The toolkit follows a domain-driven project structure, making it easier to manage and organize your project's various components.

- **Feature Integration:** Connect and establish the flow of game states and features seamlessly, promoting efficient interaction between different parts of your prototype.

- **Decoupling Features:** The toolkit encourages feature modularity, allowing you to develop and test different gameplay elements independently.

- **Prerequisite: Basic Unity Understanding Required:** To effectively utilize the toolkit, a fundamental understanding of Unity's concepts and workflows is recommended.

- **Time Savings:** Save time by leveraging the toolkit's built-in logic, allowing you to focus on the unique aspects of your prototype.

- **Enhanced Testing:** The toolkit's design facilitates efficient testing, enabling you to iterate and refine your prototype's mechanics rapidly.
